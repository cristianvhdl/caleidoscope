# Caleidoscope video generator with edge enhacement filter

FreeFull's caleidoscope-alike video generator adapted for FPGA
by DigitalCold, passed thru edge enhancement filter from
Mike Field and output to HDMI.

Creates ever-changing beautiful RGB color patterns on 640x480
VGA resolution, like on some screen savers.

It doesn't need external RAM for framebuffer, video is generated
on-the-fly using the state machine with only a couple of registers.

Boards readily working:

    ScarabHardware miniSpartan6+ (xilinx spartan-6)
    FleaFPGA Uno (lattice machxo2)

Might be easily ported to any.

# Credits

Idea to combine FreeFull's generator with Hamsterwork's edge enhancement
came from Goran Mahovlic.
