# Caleidoscope-alike effect with edge enhacement filter

FreeFull's caleidoscope video generator adapted for FPGA
by DigitalCold, passed thru edge enhancement filter from
Mike Field and output to HDMI.

Boards readily working: scarab.
Might be easily ported to any.

Combination of those two effects suggested by Goran Mahovlic.
